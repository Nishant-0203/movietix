## Movie Ticket Management System (Spring Boot)

Base URL: `http://localhost:8080`

Notes
- Unsecured root `/` will return 403 (expected). Public endpoints live under `/api/auth/**`.
- All protected requests require header: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`.
- Content type for bodies: `Content-Type: application/json`.

### 1) Authentication (Public)

```http
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "name": "John Doe",

```

Login (returns JWT)
```http
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "secret123"
}
```
Response
```json

```
